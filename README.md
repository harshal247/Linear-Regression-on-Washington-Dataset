# Linear-Regression-on-Washington-Dataset

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions,
precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors.

The code fits a linear regression model to the dataset to predict the demand for the bikes based on the given features. day.csv is imported and 
cleaned to remove any unrelated features from the dataset. Furthermore, the dataset is split into training and testing data using train_test_split() 
method from sklearn. The model is then validated using R2 and RMSE metrics.
